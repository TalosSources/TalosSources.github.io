    <h1>2048 3x3 RL Solver</h1>
    <h2>Date: October 24, 2024</h2>
    
    This fall, I got addicted to the 3x3 version of the game 2048. I decided to train a RL agent to play the game better than me to bore myself of it, which it almost did.
    
    I started from the code of the project for the class CS-456 about RL I had last spring. It is a simple but versatile actor critic algorithm that was easy to repurpose for 2048. About 1:30 hour of training yields an agent that obtains 256+128+64+32 quite reliably, and sometimes gets to 512, which is quite stronger than my own performances.

    The code is available <a href="https://github.com/talossources/2048-RL-Solver">here</a>
